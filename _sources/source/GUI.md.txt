- check if subtree crossover is in ARIEL
- add image of GUI for example.  -->
# GUI
## Currently work in progress and thus not usable.

## What you can the GUI do?
This graphical user interface (GUI) provides an interactive, node-based workspace where users can visually create, connect, and manage the evolutionary operators in the experiments. 

Instead of relying solely on text or code, the node editor allows tasks to be represented as nodes. The window typically consists of a canvas for arranging nodes, connectors for defining relationships, and panels for adjusting properties. 

This can be seen on the example below, where we have selected tournament selection with a tournament size of 5 for parent selection and subtree crossover for the crossover operator
